# CineGenie
CineGenie automates screenplay visualization by extracting scenes, recognizing entities, generating images, and compiling them into a video. It includes modules for PDF parsing, NLP-based entity recognition, AI-driven image generation, and video creation. Built with Python, spaCy, PyPDF2, and moviepy, it streamlines pre-production for filmmakers.
