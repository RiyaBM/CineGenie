# **CineGenie** - AI-Powered Screenplay Analysis & Visualization  

## **Overview**  
CineGenie automates scene visualization from film scripts by parsing the screenplay, extracting scene descriptions and entities, generating images, and compiling them into a video.  

### **Key Features:**  
âœ… Scene extraction from a PDF screenplay  
âœ… Named Entity Recognition (NER) for characters, locations, and objects  
âœ… AI-powered image generation based on scene descriptions  
âœ… Video compilation from generated images  

---  

## **Project Structure**  
The project consists of four main Python modules:  

- **`pdf_parser.py`** - Extracts scenes from a film script PDF.  
- **`ner_extractor.py`** - Uses spaCy's NLP model to identify characters, locations, and objects.  
- **`image_generator.py`** - Sends scene descriptions to an image generation API to create images.  
- **`video_creator.py`** - Compiles generated images into a video file.

## **Screenplay**  
The screenplay for *The Pursuit of Happyness* is included in the project.  

### **Example Output**  
Below are sample images generated from the scenes:
